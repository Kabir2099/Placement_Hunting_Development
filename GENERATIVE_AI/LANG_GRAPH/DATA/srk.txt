Shah Rukh Khan[a] (pronounced [ˈʃaːɦɾʊx xäːn] ⓘ; born 2 November 1965), also known by the initialism SRK, is an Indian actor and film producer who works in Hindi cinema. Referred to in the media as the "Baadshah of Bollywood" and "King Khan",[b] he has appeared in more than 100 films, and earned numerous accolades, including 14 Filmfare Awards. He has been awarded the Padma Shri by the Government of India, as well as the Order of Arts and Letters and Legion of Honour by the Government of France. Khan has a significant following in Asia and the Indian diaspora worldwide. In terms of audience size and income, several media outlets have described him as one of the most successful film stars in the world.[c] Many of his films thematise Indian national identity and connections with diaspora communities, or gender, racial, social and religious differences and grievances.

Khan began his career with appearances in several television series in the late 1980s and made his Bollywood debut in 1992 with the musical romance Deewana. He was initially recognised for playing villainous roles in the films Baazigar (1993) and Darr (1993). Khan established himself by starring in a series of top-grossing romantic films, including Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge (1995), Dil To Pagal Hai (1997), Kuch Kuch Hota Hai (1998), Mohabbatein (2000), Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... (2001), Kal Ho Naa Ho (2003), Veer-Zaara (2004) and Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna (2006). He earned critical acclaim for his portrayal of an alcoholic in the period romantic drama Devdas (2002), a NASA scientist in the social drama Swades (2004), a hockey coach in the sports drama Chak De! India (2007), and a man with Asperger syndrome in the drama My Name Is Khan (2010). Further commercial successes came with the romances Om Shanti Om (2007) and Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi (2008), and with his expansion to comedies in Chennai Express (2013) and Happy New Year (2014). Following a brief setback and hiatus, Khan made a career comeback with the 2023 action thrillers Pathaan and Jawan, both of which rank among the highest-grossing Indian films.

As of 2015, Khan is co-chairman of the motion picture production company Red Chillies Entertainment and its subsidiaries and is the co-owner of the Indian Premier League cricket team Kolkata Knight Riders and the Caribbean Premier League team Trinbago Knight Riders. The media often label him as "Brand SRK" because of his many endorsements and entrepreneurship ventures. He is a frequent television presenter and stage show performer. Khan's philanthropic endeavours have provided health care and disaster relief, and he was honoured with UNESCO's Pyramide con Marni award in 2011 for his support of children's education and the World Economic Forum's Crystal Award in 2018 for advocating for women's and children's rights in India. He regularly features in listings of the most influential people in Indian culture, and in 2008, Newsweek named him one of their fifty most powerful people in the world. In 2022, Khan was voted one of the 50 greatest actors of all time in a readers' poll by Empire, and in 2023, Time named him as one of the most influential people in the world.[3]

Early life and family
Parents
Khan's father, Meer Taj Mohammed Khan, was an Indian independence activist from Peshawar who campaigned alongside the Khudai Khidmatgar, a nonviolent resistance movement led by Abdul Ghaffar Khan that sought a united and independent India.[4][5] Mir was a follower of Abdul Ghaffar Khan,[6] and affiliated with the Indian National Congress.[7] He was also the cousin of the major general in the Indian National Army Shah Nawaz Khan.[d] According to Khan his paternal grandfather, Mir Jan Muhammad Khan, was an ethnic Pashtun (Pathan) from Afghanistan.[10][7][11] However, his paternal cousins in Peshawar later clarified that the family speaks Hindko and is originally from Kashmir, from where they settled in Peshawar centuries back, contradicting the claim that his grandfather was a Pashtun from Afghanistan.[7][12] As of 2010, Khan's paternal family was still living in the Shah Wali Qataal area of Peshawar's Qissa Khwani Bazaar.[7]

In 1946, Mir moved to Delhi to study law at Delhi University.[13] When the partition of India occurred in 1947, he was forced to stay in Delhi, and did not return to Peshawar until many years later.[14] Khan's mother, Lateef Fatima, a magistrate, was the daughter of a senior government engineer.[15][d][16] His parents were married in 1959.[17]

Early life
Khan was born on 2 November 1965 into a Muslim family in New Delhi.[18] He spent the first five years of his life in Mangalore, where his maternal grandfather, Iftikhar Ahmed, served as chief engineer of the port in the 1960s.[19][20][e] Khan has described himself on Twitter as "half Hyderabadi (mother), half Pathan (father), and some Kashmiri (grandmother)".[22]


His father died of cancer in 1981,[f] and his mother died in 1991 from complications of diabetes.[37] After the death of their parents, his older sister, Shahnaz Lalarukh (born 1960)[38] fell into a depressed state and Khan took on the responsibility of caring for her.[35][39] Shahnaz continues to live with her brother and his family in their Mumbai mansion.[40]

Acting career

1988–1992: Television and film debut
Khan's first starring role was in Lekh Tandon's television series Dil Dariya, which began shooting in 1988, but production delays led to the Raj Kumar Kapoor directed 1989 series Fauji becoming his television debut instead.[41] In the series, which depicted a realistic look at the training of army cadets, he played the leading role of Abhimanyu Rai.[42][43] This led to further appearances in Aziz Mirza's television series Circus (1989–90) and Mani Kaul's miniseries Idiot (1992).[44] Khan also played minor parts in the serials Umeed (1989) and Wagle Ki Duniya (1988–90),[44] and in the English-language television film In Which Annie Gives It Those Ones (1989).[45] His appearances in these serials led critics to compare his look and acting style with those of the film actor Dilip Kumar,[46] but Khan was not interested in film acting at the time, thinking that he was not good enough.[44][47]

Khan changed his decision to act in films in April 1991,[48] citing it as a way to escape the grief of his mother's death.[49] He moved from Delhi to Mumbai to pursue a full-time career in Bollywood and was quickly signed to four films.[48] His first offer was for Hema Malini's directorial debut Dil Aashna Hai,[34][42] and by June, he had started his first shoot.[50] His film debut was in Deewana, which was released in June 1992.[51] In it he starred alongside Divya Bharti as the second male lead behind Rishi Kapoor. Deewana became a box office hit and launched Khan's Bollywood career;[52] he earned the Filmfare Best Male Debut Award for his performance.[53] Also released in 1992 were Khan's first films as the male lead, Chamatkar, Dil Aashna Hai, and the comedy Raju Ban Gaya Gentleman, which was his first of many collaborations with the actress Juhi Chawla.[54] His initial film roles saw him play characters who displayed energy and enthusiasm. According to Arnab Ray of Daily News and Analysis, Khan brought a new kind of acting as he was "sliding down stairs on a slab of ice, cartwheeling, somersaulting, lips trembling, eyes trembling, bringing to the screen the kind of physical energy ... visceral, intense, maniacal one moment and cloyingly boyish the next."[55]




2023–present: Resurgence
In 2023, Khan reunited with Yash Raj Films in the action thriller Pathaan (2023), set in the YRF Spy Universe, in which he played an exiled field agent assigned to stop a terrorist attack in India.[201] Critic Sukanya Verma took note of Khan's "weathered intensity, grizzly charisma and trademark wit", while Kaveree Bamzai termed it a "much-needed makeover" of an ageing Khan into an action star.[202][203] Pathaan broke several box-office records, thus re-establishing Khan's stardom.[204][205] Khan took on another action film role in the same year in Atlee's Jawan, playing father and son doppelgängers.[206] Nandini Ramnath of Scroll.in wrote that "Khan's screen image – expansive, suffused with love, heroic in an old-fashioned way without being aggressively macho, irreverent but also sincere – helps sell a conceit that might have crashed with any other actor".[207] Jawan broke the records set by Pathaan.[208] Both films grossed over ₹10 billion (US$110 million) to rank, respectively, as Hindi cinema's second and third biggest grossers worldwide,[209] making Khan the first Indian actor to deliver two films that earned over ₹10 billion.[210]

In his final release of 2023, Khan starred in Rajkumar Hirani's Dunki, a social drama about an illegal immigration technique named donkey flight.[211][212] Uday Bhatia wrote that his role as a "romantic feminist soldier patriot friend" marked "a break from Khan the action star but offers no respite from the Khan the perfect screen idol".[213] Grossing over ₹4 billion (US$46 million), Dunki emerged as Khan's third consecutive commercial success of the year, although it did not match up to the record grosses of Pathaan or Jawan.[214][215]


Ownership of Kolkata Knight Riders
In 2008, Khan, in partnership with Juhi Chawla and her husband Jay Mehta, acquired ownership rights for the franchise representing Kolkata in the Twenty20 cricket tournament Indian Premier League (IPL) for US$75.09 million, and named the team Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR).[242] As of 2009, KKR was one of the richest teams in the IPL, with a brand value of US$42.1 million.[243] The team performed poorly on the field during the first three years.[244] Their performance improved over time, and they became the champions for the first time in 2012[244] and repeated the feat in 2014.[245] The Knight Riders hold the record for the longest winning streak by any Indian team in T20s (14).[246] They won their third IPL title in the 2024 edition.[247]
